-- Our program written in Clion in language C and we using the compiler GCC --

In this EX we ipmlement active object design pattern.
We implemented a queue struct which is thread save using mutex and cond.
also we implemented a active object struct that creates a thread in every creation of it.
we wrote 4 functions according to the  EX plus 2 function for detecting prime numbers.
each function has it assignment and the result is transferd to the next function according to the order 1->2->3->4

the N you enter in the excution is for the program to know how many random numbers to generate and you can enter the seed for the rand function.


To run the program you need to open a terminal in the project folder and write:

-> make

-> ./st_pipeline <N> <seed>(optional)


in the zip folder you will find a run example photos from our program : run1.png run2.png
